    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The road through computer science 1 has been a bumpy road full of ups and downs. Here are some of the highlights from the trimester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights from the Trimester\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Below are some of the projects I worked on and skills I developed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Using background.md and sprites in vscode to create my own background with a moving sprite. This ended up being a very useful skill for later group projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ##### The website my team and I created with the controllable car background with the shops showing you how to successfully set up for comp sci 1. In that project I was in charge of creating the buttons and adjusting them to the shop store signs. This was a really nifty skill I learned that i'll be able to apply to any future projects I work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the website background my team and I worked on:\n",
    "[![Picture of Shops background](/images/Carbackgroundwithshops.png)](https://precia-verma.github.io/Group-projects/background)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### My group presented two lessons, one on arrays and another on booleans. For the array lesson I co-wrote a blog with my team member oliver and that was the lesson we used to teach our classmates what an array was and how to use it. For the boolean lesson, I made the homeowork page that included a quick recap on booleans and a short quiz. Unfortunately there were some last minute changes to the quiz I was unaware of so the quiz became somewhat faulty. Next time I will strive for better comunication and understanding in group projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the Array lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Picture of Array lesson](/images/arraylessonss.png)](https://precia-verma.github.io/Group-projects/array)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the Boolean HW:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Picture of Boolean Hw](/images/Booleanhwss.png)](https://precia-verma.github.io/Group-projects/boolean-homework)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Together as a team, my group created level 2 of our class mansion game. We worked on a cemetary game that resembled a memory game. In the making of our game, I made the initial background files for both the entrance background and game background, and in the game background I made a start button followed by a quick intructions pannel that would slowly disappear as soon as you click on the start button. The screen would then change to the game screen. Unfortunately our game started to have multiple bugs at the end so to fix all our errors we had to create a new version of our game files in a new repo. So our end game product did not include some features such as the start button and instructions I made. I also made the script that we used to present for the finals presentation during the N@tM. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Key elements from Sprints \n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Javascript Basics: Through the student made and taught lessons I was able to learn how to use let statements, conditions such as if , else, and else if. As well as for loops and functions, I even learned how to make arrays in my code, and we touched base with DOM which is used to change text dynamically and make your code interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Tools: In the beginning I installed vscode and logged into a github account and developed a skill to connect the two platforms for my repositories so I could work with my group on projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments and reflection from N@tM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### We presented to a group of parents circles around our moniter and they seemed to be engaged in our game and with what we had to say about the process of making it and its capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Having the parents interact with the actual playing of the game was successful because it not only made the parents laugh and enjoy themselves but it also relieved some of the pressures of presenting by creating a more relaxed environment \n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth Through the Trimester:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Compared to the beginning of the year I must say I have improved without a doubt. In the first month, just using the command make on my chromebook seemed like an impossible task. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Through the gradual progression through the tools and equipment, and learning of different commands for setting up your virtual environment like \" ./scripts/venv.sh\" and \"source venv/bin/activate\" have become like a second nature to me whenever I am git cloning a new repository in my terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What I'd like to do next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### If we had more time I would want to create an app together with my group that works on computers, hopefully mobile, depending on how far we would get. It'd be fun if the class got prompted an issue, any issue like maybe organizing homework by due date or priority, or maybe an app for some start up that wants to bring food to homeless san diegans. Together your group would create an app that would best represent the prompt given. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What i'd like to learn in computer science: \n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### I would like to learn how to do the actual coding part of comp sci, like know how to build a small randomizing game. I know we kind of learned some basic forms of coding but it was very brief and I'm not very comfortable with it yet. "

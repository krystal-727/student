# Krystal's Blog – September 9, 2025

Welcome to my blog! Today, I want to share journey through vscode and githup pages with you.

## Getting Started with GitHub Pages

First, you have to start a personal page with Github, here is what you need to do:
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
- Then, you need to add a simple `index.md` file to get started.

## Using Markdown

Markdown adjusts writing content and makes it simple and easier to understand. Some features that are helpful:
- **Headings** for structure
- **Lists** for organization
- **Links** and **images** for informative content

## In the beginning

I learned how to:
1. Create posts using Markdown.
2. Organize posts in folders.
3. Preview my site locally before publishing.

## My goals for the future: 

I intend to:
- Customize and personlize my site’s theme.
- Continue adding posts and improving the content of my site.
- Share my experience with others learning how to code to help ease their journey.

Thank you for reading!

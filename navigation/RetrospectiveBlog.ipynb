    "The road through computer science 1 has been a bumpy road full of ups and downs. Here are some of the highlights from the trimester.\n",

    "Below are some of the projects I worked on and skills I developed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using background.md and sprites in vscode to create my own background with a moving sprite. This ended up being a very useful skill for later group projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The website my team and I created with the controllable car background with the shops showing you how to successfully set up for comp sci 1. In that project I was in charge of creating the buttons and adjusting them to the shop store signs. This was a really nifty skill I learned that i'll be able to apply to any future projects I work on.\n",

    "- My group presented two lessons, one on arrays and another on booleans. For the array lesson I co-wrote a blog with my team member oliver and that was the lesson we used to teach our classmates what an array was and how to use it. For the boolean lesson, I made the homeowork page that included a quick recap on booleans and a short quiz. Unfortunately there were some last minute changes to the quiz I was unaware of so the quiz became somehwat faulty. Next time I will strive for better comunication and understanding in group projects. \n",

    "- Together as a team, my group created level 2 of our class mansion game. We worked on a cemetary game that resembled a memory game. In the making of our game, I made the initial background files for both the entrance background and game background, and in the game background I made a start button followed by a quick intructions pannel that would slowly disappear as soon as you click on the start button. The screen would then change to the game screen. Unfortunately our game started to have multiple bugs at the end so to fix all our errors we had to create a new version of our game files in a new repo. So our end game product did no include some features such as the start button and instrcutions I made. \n",
